## SECTION I: CORE EVENTS
---

### nde:event::cosmic_creation
In the beginning, before existence was defined, there was only the primordial sea, Nammu, the self-engendered mother of all. From her waters, she gave birth to the cosmic mountain, a single, fused entity known as An-Ki (Heaven-Earth). An (the male sky principle) and Ki (the female earth principle) were inseparable within this mountain. Within their union, they conceived Enlil, the Lord of Air and Breath. Driven by the necessity of creating space for being, Enlil executed the first great act of cosmic separation. With the force of the wind, he violently cleaved An-Ki apart. He pushed An upwards to become the high heavens and laid Ki down below to form the flat disc of the earth. This sundering of heaven from earth ordered the cosmos, creating the Lil (the atmospheric space between) where life and the affairs of gods and mortals could unfold. Enlil's act established the fundamental structure of reality, positioning him as the chief of the new pantheon and the executor of the divine will within the newly formed world.

### nde:event::creation_of_humanity
Following the ordering of the cosmos [REF: nde:event::cosmic_creation], the lesser gods, the Igigi, were put to work, tasked with digging the great canals and maintaining the earthly realm for the Anunnaki. After long ages of toil, the Igigi rebelled, burning their tools and surrounding the temple of the chief god, Enlil. The pantheon was in crisis. Enki, the clever lord of wisdom and the freshwater abyss (the Abzu), proposed a solution: create a new class of being to bear the toil of the gods. With the assent of the council, Enki and the mother goddess Nintu (Ki) shaped a being from the clay of the Abzu. To grant it a measure of divine intelligence, they sacrificed the god Geshtu-E, 'the god who had an ear,' and mixed his blood and spirit into the clay. Thus, the Lullu Amelu—the 'Savage Man'—was created, fashioned as a worker and a servant to provide for the Anunnaki so they could remain at peace.

### nde:event::the_great_flood
As millennia passed, the population of humanity [REF: nde:event::creation_of_humanity] grew vast upon the Earth. Their noise and clamor became incessant, rising to the heavens and profoundly disturbing Enlil, who could find no sleep. Enraged, Enlil persuaded the divine assembly to approve a final solution: a great flood to annihilate all of humankind. Bound by an oath of secrecy, Enki could not warn humanity directly. Instead, he went to the reed-hut of his faithful servant, Ziusudra of Shuruppak, and spoke to the wall. He revealed the gods' plan and instructed Ziusudra to dismantle his house, build an immense cube-like boat, waterproof it with bitumen, and load it with his family and the seed of all living things. The deluge came, a terrifying storm that lasted seven days and seven nights, covering the land and drowning every human that Enlil despised. When the waters receded, Ziusudra opened a window and saw the devastation. He made a sacrifice to the gods, who, starved for sustenance, descended to the offering. Enlil was livid upon discovering survivors, but Enki interceded, arguing for humanity's preservation. A new accord was reached: humanity would be allowed to continue, but would henceforth be subject to mortality, disease, and the hardships of life to keep them from growing too numerous.

## SECTION II: LOCATIONS & REALMS
---

### Abzu
The subterranean realm of primordial fresh water, magic, and ultimate wisdom, ruled by the god Enki [Associated Deity: nde:deity::enki]. It is the source of the clay used to create humanity and the wellspring of all esoteric knowledge.

### Dilmun
A mythical paradise, a garden land free from sickness, age, and death. It is associated with the god Enki and was granted to the flood hero Ziusudra [Associated Character: nde:character::ziusudra] as his eternal abode.

### Eridu
The first city, established by Enki in the primordial wetlands near the Abzu. Considered the sacred home of wisdom and magic, its temple, the E-abzu (House of the Abyss), rose as a testament to the lord of the deep. [Associated Deity: Enki]

### Kur (The Underworld)
The Land of No Return, a grim, dusty realm ruled by Queen Ereshkigal [Associated Deity: nde:deity::ereshkigal]. It is a cavernous darkness beneath the earth, from which no mortal or god who enters may leave without a substitute. The setting for Inanna's famous descent.

### Nippur
The supreme spiritual center of the Anunnaki dominion, ruled not by a king but directly by the clergy of Enlil. Its temple, the E-kur (House of the Mountain), was where the great assembly of the gods convened and where the will of the pantheon was executed. [Associated Deity: Enlil]

### Shuruppak
An ancient human city on the banks of the Euphrates. It gained eternal significance as the home of the pious Ziusudra, who received Enki's secret warning and built the great boat that survived the Deluge. [Key Event: The Great Flood [REF: nde:event::the_great_flood]]

## SECTION III: ARTIFACTS & CONCEPTS (WORLD RULES)
---

### Tablet of Destinies
A sacred clay tablet, inscribed with cuneiform, that legitimizes the supreme authority of the god who possesses it. It controls the destinies of both gods and mortals, giving its bearer the ultimate power to command the forces of the universe and decree the future. Held by Enlil as a symbol of his divine right as chief of the pantheon. [Associated Deity: Enlil]

### The Me (Divine Decrees)
A set of universal decrees and fundamental concepts embodying all aspects of divine and civilized life. The Me represent everything from abstract concepts like 'truth' and 'kingship' to tangible arts like 'writing' and 'smithing.' They are not physical objects, but divine powers that can be held and wielded. They were gathered and are safeguarded by Enki in his city of Eridu. [Associated Deity: Enki]
