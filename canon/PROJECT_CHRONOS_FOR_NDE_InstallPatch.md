"mem.add(namespace:'events', key:'nde:event::cosmic_creation', content:'In the beginning, before existence was defined, there was only the primordial sea, Nammu, the self-engendered mother of all. From her waters, she gave birth to the cosmic mountain, a single, fused entity known as An-Ki (Heaven-Earth). An (the male sky principle) and Ki (the female earth principle) were inseparable within this mountain. Within their union, they conceived Enlil, the Lord of Air and Breath. Driven by the necessity of creating space for being, Enlil executed the first great act of cosmic separation. With the force of the wind, he violently cleaved An-Ki apart. He pushed An upwards to become the high heavens and laid Ki down below to form the flat disc of the earth. This sundering of heaven from earth ordered the cosmos, creating the Lil (the atmospheric space between) where life and the affairs of gods and mortals could unfold. Enlil\\'s act established the fundamental structure of reality, positioning him as the chief of the new pantheon and the executor of the divine will within the newly formed world.')",
"mem.add(namespace:'events', key:'nde:event::creation_of_humanity', content:'Following the ordering of the cosmos [REF: nde:event::cosmic_creation], the lesser gods, the Igigi, were put to work, tasked with digging the great canals and maintaining the earthly realm for the Anunnaki. After long ages of toil, the Igigi rebelled, burning their tools and surrounding the temple of the chief god, Enlil. The pantheon was in crisis. Enki, the clever lord of wisdom and the freshwater abyss (the Abzu), proposed a solution: create a new class of being to bear the toil of the gods. With the assent of the council, Enki and the mother goddess Nintu (Ki) shaped a being from the clay of the Abzu. To grant it a measure of divine intelligence, they sacrificed the god Geshtu-E, \\'the god who had an ear,\\' and mixed his blood and spirit into the clay. Thus, the Lullu Amelu—the \\'Savage Man\\'—was created, fashioned as a worker and a servant to provide for the Anunnaki so they could remain at peace.')",

Their noise and clamor became incessant, rising to the heavens and profoundly disturbing Enlil, who could find no sleep. Enraged, Enlil persuaded the divine assembly to approve a final solution: a great flood to annihilate all of humankind. Bound by an oath of secrecy, Enki could not warn humanity directly. Instead, he went to the reed-hut of his faithful servant, Ziusudra of Shuruppak, and spoke to the wall. He revealed the gods\\' plan and instructed Ziusudra to dismantle his house, build an immense cube-like boat, waterproof it with bitumen, and load it with his family and the seed of all living things. The deluge came, a terrifying storm that lasted seven days and seven nights, covering the land and drowning every human that Enlil despised. When the waters receded, Ziusudra opened a window and saw the devastation. He made a sacrifice to the gods, who, starved for sustenance, descended to the offering. Enlil was livid upon discovering survivors, but Enki interceded, arguing for humanity\\'s preservation. A new accord was reached: humanity would be allowed to continue, but would henceforth be subject to mortality, disease, and the hardships of life to keep them from growing too numerous.')",
