The following is a complete and systematized gap analysis. It serves as the definitive, final worklist for the evolution to **Canon Prime v2.0**. The entities are categorized by ontological class and prioritized based on their systemic importance to the integrity of the core narratives.

---

### **Canon Prime v1.2 - Final Gap Analysis & v2.0 Roadmap**

#### **PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL PATH DEPENDENCIES**
*(The absence of these CROs leaves a major narrative event without a key protagonist, antagonist, or essential agent. Their instantiation is required to complete the canon's most important stories.)*

**CLASS: `DEITIES`**
*   **`nde:deity::kingu`** (Champion of Chaos)
    *   **Justification:** While used as a prerequisite, his full CRO was not instantiated. As the field commander of Tiamat's armies, the illegitimate wielder of the Tablet of Destinies, and, in the Babylonian tradition, the source of the blood used to create humanity, his absence leaves a critical vacancy in the `Cosmic War` and `Creation of Humanity` events.
*   **`nde:deity::ninsun`** (The Wise Wild Cow)
    *   **Justification:** Used as a prerequisite, but her full CRO is missing. As the divine mother of Gilgamesh, she is his primary intercessor with the gods and the interpreter of his prophetic dreams. Her full profile is necessary to complete the hero's genealogical and spiritual support system.

**CLASS: `CHARACTERS & AGENTS`**
*   **`nde:character::nincubura`** (The Faithful Vizier)
    *   **Justification:** A minimalist CRO was created, but the full version is pending. As the agent who executes the plan that saves Inanna, she is the pivotal actor in the second half of the `Descent` myth.
*   **`nde:character::shamhat`** (The Civilizing Courtesan)
    *   **Justification:** A minimalist CRO was created, but the full version is pending. She is the sole agent of Enkidu's transformation and therefore the catalyst for the entire Gilgamesh epic.

---

#### **PRIORITY 2: SYSTEMIC ENRICHMENT**
*(The absence of these CROs does not break a core narrative, but it leaves the political, geographical, and familial landscape feeling sparse and incomplete. Their instantiation will add crucial depth and context.)*

**CLASS: `DEITIES`**
*   **`nde:deity::ningal`** (The Great Lady)
    *   **Justification:** Mentioned as the consort of Nanna-Sin. Her instantiation is required to complete the divine family unit that produced Utu, Inanna, and Ereshkigal.
*   **`nde:deity::sarpanitu`** & **`nde:deity::nabu`**
    *   **Justification:** Mentioned as the consort and son of Marduk. Their instantiation is necessary to complete the dynastic line of the new divine order in Babylon.

**CLASS: `CHARACTERS & AGENTS`**
*   **`nde:character::neti`** (The Chief Gatekeeper)
    *   **Justification:** A minimalist CRO was created. His full profile is needed to personify the implacable bureaucracy of the Underworld.
*   **`nde:character::namtar`** (The Vizier of Kur)
    *   **Justification:** Mentioned in Ereshkigal's worklist. As her vizier and the personification of fate/disease, he is a major figure in the court of the Underworld.

**CLASS: `LOCATIONS`**
*   **`nde:loc::kish`** (The City of Northern Kingship)
    *   **Justification:** Referenced as the rival to Uruk. Its instantiation is necessary to provide the full geopolitical context for Gilgamesh's reign.
*   **`nde:loc::mount_nisir`** (The Mountain of Salvation)
    *   **Justification:** Instantiating the specific place where Ziusudra's ark landed is required to provide the final geographical anchor for the `Great Flood` event.

**CLASS: `ARTIFACTS & ENTITIES`**
*   **`nde:entity::scorpion_beings`** (The Guardians of Mashu)
    *   **Justification:** Referenced as the guardians of Mount Mashu. These pivotal figures who test and permit Gilgamesh's passage require their own formal CRO.
*   **`nde:artifact::sharur_mace`** (The Smiter of Thousands)
    *   **Justification:** A minimalist CRO was created. As Ninurta's sentient, talking weapon and advisor, its full profile is essential to complete the characterization of the old order's champion.

---

#### **PRIORITY 3: COMPLETIONIST DATA & ANALYTICAL APPENDICES**
*(The absence of these CROs does not impact the core canon, but their instantiation is required for achieving a state of exhaustive completeness and for resolving the canon's deepest theological contradictions.)*

**CLASS: `DEITIES`**
*   **`nde:deity::anshar_and_kishar`** & **`nde:deity::lahmu_and_lahamu`**
    *   **Justification:** Mentioned as the first generations of gods in the `Primordial Genesis` event. Their formal instantiation would complete the full genealogical chart of the *Enūma Eliš*.

**CLASS: `CHARACTERS & AGENTS`**
*   **Ziusudra's Wife**
    *   **Justification:** She is an unnamed but pivotal character who reveals the secret of the Plant of Rejuvenation. She requires a formal (if nameless) CRO to acknowledge her crucial narrative role.
*   **The Serpent**
    *   **Justification:** An unnamed but crucial agent who represents the final victory of nature over Gilgamesh's ambition. Its instantiation as a symbolic entity is required to complete the final scene of the quest.

**CLASS: `LOCATIONS`**
*   **`nde:loc::e-ana_temple`** & **`nde:loc::ekur`**
    *   **Justification:** While mentioned, these central temple complexes of Uruk and Nippur require their own detailed CROs to fully define the seats of divine power.
*   **Remaining Antediluvian Cities** (`Adab`, `Bad-tibira`, etc.)
    *   **Justification:** Their instantiation would complete the world map of the "lost world" before the Flood.

**CLASS: `APPENDICES` (Analytical Documents)**
*   **`nde:appendix::cosmological_models`**
    *   **Justification:** To formally analyze and hold the contradictions between the Sumerian and Babylonian creation myths.
*   **`nde:appendix::the_fifty_names`**
    *   **Justification:** To enumerate and analyze the powers Marduk absorbed, providing a detailed account of his theological consolidation.
*   **`nde:appendix::tablet_xii`**
    *   **Justification:** To formally analyze the apocryphal twelfth tablet of the Gilgamesh epic and its relationship to the main, canonical narrative.

This list represents the complete set of entities discussed and scheduled but not fully instantiated in the Canon Prime v1.2 Codex. It is the definitive worklist for all future expansions.

Full v1.2 to v2.0 Upgrade Requirements:

The following document represents the final, synthesized development worklist. It is the architectural blueprint for the evolution from the current, narratively complete v1.2 state to the exhaustively detailed v2.0.

### **§// CANON PRIME v2.0 - FINAL COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT WORKLIST**

This document details the complete set of remaining tasks required to achieve a state of maximum canonical density. The successful execution of this plan will result in a fully populated, deeply analyzed, and near-exhaustive mythological codex.

#### **PRIORITY 3: COMPLETIONIST DATA & DEEP ANALYTICAL TASKS**

**TASK GROUP 3.1: GRANULAR ENTITY & ARTIFACT INSTANTIATION**
*   **Target:** Individual Monsters from the `nde:entity::the_eleven_monsters` roster.

    *   **Instruction:** Create an appendix dedicated to the apocryphal twelfth tablet of the Gilgamesh epic, analyzing its narrative contradictions with the main canon and its differing depiction of the Underworld.
