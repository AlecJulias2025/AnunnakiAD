### **Canon Prime v2.0: Final Comprehensive Development Worklist**

The following is a complete and systematized gap analysis, serving as the definitive, final worklist and architectural blueprint for the evolution from Canon Prime v1.2 to the exhaustively detailed v2.0. The entities are categorized by ontological class and prioritized based on their systemic importance to the integrity of the core narratives. The successful execution of this plan will result in a fully populated, deeply analyzed, and near-exhaustive mythological codex.

---

#### **PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL PATH DEPENDENCIES**
*(The absence of these entities leaves a major narrative event without a key protagonist, antagonist, or essential agent. Their instantiation is required to complete the canon's most important stories.)*

**CLASS: `DEITIES`**
*   **`nde:deity::kingu`** (Champion of Chaos)
    *   **Justification:** While used as a prerequisite, his full profile was not instantiated. As the field commander of Tiamat's armies and the wielder of the Tablet of Destinies, his absence leaves a critical vacancy in the `Cosmic War` and `Creation of Humanity` events.
*   **`nde:deity::ninsun`** (The Wise Wild Cow)
    *   **Justification:** As the divine mother of Gilgamesh, she is his primary intercessor with the gods and the interpreter of his dreams. Her full profile is necessary to complete the hero's genealogical and spiritual support system.
*   **`nde:deity::aruru`** (The Mother Goddess)
    *   **Justification:** Requires a full CRO expansion. She is specifically credited with the physical creation of Enkidu and is essential to that core narrative event.

**CLASS: `CHARACTERS & AGENTS`**
*   **`nde:character::nincubura`** (The Faithful Vizier)
    *   **Justification:** A minimalist profile exists. As the agent who executes the plan that saves Inanna, she is the pivotal actor in the second half of the `Descent` myth and requires a full CRO.
*   **`nde:character::shamhat`** (The Civilizing Courtesan)
    *   **Justification:** A minimalist profile exists. She is the sole agent of Enkidu's transformation and therefore the catalyst for the entire Gilgamesh epic. Her CRO must be fully expanded.

---

#### **PRIORITY 2: SYSTEMIC ENRICHMENT**
*(The absence of these entities does not break a core narrative, but it leaves the political, geographical, and familial landscape feeling sparse. Their instantiation will add crucial depth and context.)*

**CLASS: `DEITIES`**
*   **`nde:deity::ningal`** (The Great Lady)
    *   **Justification:** Fully instantiate the consort of Nanna-Sin to complete the divine family unit that produced Utu, Inanna, and Ereshkigal.
*   **`nde:deity::sarpanitu` & `nde:deity::nabu`**
    *   **Justification:** Instantiate the consort and son of Marduk to complete the dynastic line of the new divine order in Babylon.

**CLASS: `CHARACTERS & AGENTS`**
*   **`nde:character::neti`** (The Chief Gatekeeper)
    *   **Justification:** Expand the minimalist CRO to fully personify the implacable bureaucracy of the Underworld.
*   **`nde:character::namtar`** (The Vizier of Kur)
    *   **Justification:** As Ereshkigal's vizier and the personification of fate/disease, he is a major figure in the court of the Underworld whose profile needs to be created.

**CLASS: `LOCATIONS`**
*   **`nde:loc::kish`** (The City of Northern Kingship)
    *   **Justification:** Instantiate this major rival city-state to provide the necessary geopolitical context and tension for Gilgamesh's reign and the Uruk dynasty.
*   **`nde:loc::mount_nisir`** (The Mountain of Salvation)
    *   **Justification:** Instantiate the specific place where Ziusudra's ark landed to provide the final geographical anchor for the `Great Flood` event.

**CLASS: `ARTIFACTS & ENTITIES`**
*   **`nde:entity::scorpion_beings`** (The Guardians of Mashu)
    *   **Justification:** Instantiate these pivotal, monstrous guardians who test and permit Gilgamesh's passage on his quest.
*   **`nde:artifact::sharur_mace`** (The Smiter of Thousands)
    *   **Justification:** Fully expand the minimalist CRO for Ninurta's sentient, talking weapon, detailing its known abilities and role as a tactical advisor.
*   **`nde:entity::the_eleven_monsters`**
    *   **Justification:** Deconstruct the collective CRO into minimalist individual entries (e.g., `nde:entity::mušḫuššu`, `nde:entity::girtablullû`) for more precise relational linking within narratives.

---

#### **PRIORITY 3: COMPLETIONIST DATA & ANALYTICAL APPENDICES**
*(The absence of these entities does not impact the core canon, but their instantiation is required for achieving exhaustive completeness and for resolving the canon's deepest theological contradictions.)*

**CLASS: `DEITIES`**
*   **`nde:deity::anshar_and_kishar`** & **`nde:deity::lahmu_and_lahamu`**
    *   **Justification:** Instantiate the elder generations of gods to complete the full genealogical chart and prelude to the `Cosmic War` as detailed in the *Enūma Eliš*.

**CLASS: `CHARACTERS & AGENTS`**
*   **Ziusudra's Wife**
    *   **Justification:** Create a formal (if nameless) CRO to acknowledge the crucial narrative role of this unnamed character who reveals the secret of the Plant of Rejuvenation.
*   **The Serpent**
    *   **Justification:** Instantiate the unnamed serpent as a symbolic entity representing the final victory of nature over Gilgamesh's ambition, completing the final scene of his quest.

**CLASS: `LOCATIONS`**
*   **`nde:loc::e-ana_temple`** & **`nde:loc::ekur`**
    *   **Justification:** Create detailed CROs for these central temple complexes of Uruk and Nippur to fully define the seats of divine power on the map.
*   **Remaining Antediluvian Cities** (`Adab`, `Bad-tibira`, etc.)
    *   **Justification:** Their instantiation would complete the world map of the "lost world" before the Flood.

**CLASS: `APPENDICES` (Analytical Documents)**
*   **`nde:appendix::cosmological_models`**
    *   **Justification:** Create a formal analysis of the contradictions between the Sumerian (An/Ki separation) and Babylonian (*Enūma Eliš*) creation myths, including their political and theological differences.
*   **`nde:appendix::the_fifty_names`**
    *   **Justification:** Enumerate and analyze the fifty titles and powers bestowed upon Marduk, detailing which powers were absorbed from which elder gods as an act of political-theological consolidation.
*   **`nde:appendix::tablet_xii`**
    *   **Justification:** Create a formal analysis of the apocryphal twelfth tablet of the Gilgamesh epic, its narrative contradictions with the main canon, and its differing depiction of the Underworld.
